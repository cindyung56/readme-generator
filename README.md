## Description

This is a program that allows users to create a professional README markdown document without having to write all of the sections by themselves! The purpose of this application is to provide a user with a list of questions that they can answer about their program, and then the app will take their answers and compile it in a freshly created README document. This includes creating a description of the project, how to install, how to use it, and more. All of the sections in the README file will be automatically created and even includes a table of contents for easy navigation!

## Installation

You can install this program by going to the GitHub repository and downloading the .zip folder that includes all of the code.

## Usage

To use this program, first open up the terminal and navigate to the program folder. Next, install all the required npm packages using ``npm i``. Then type ``node index.js`` in the terminal to run the index.js file. This will then prompt you various questions about the project you are trying to write the README document for. Answer all questions as best as possible, and then the file will be created in the same folder!
